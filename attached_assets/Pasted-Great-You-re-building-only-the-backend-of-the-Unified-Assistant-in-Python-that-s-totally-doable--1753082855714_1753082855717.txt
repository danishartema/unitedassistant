Great! You're building only the backend of the Unified Assistant in Python — that’s totally doable. Let me break this down in simple terms, summarizing what the document says and what you need to do step-by-step as a Python backend developer.

🧭 What They’re Telling You (Simplified)
They want a backend system that powers an AI assistant which:

Helps users create complex documents in 14 phases.

Remembers everything the user says (even months later).

Understands when previous steps change and updates future steps.

Supports saving, editing, inviting collaborators, and exporting outputs.

✅ Your Goal (Backend Only)
Build the backend logic, database, APIs, AI integration, and background task system that:

Handles users, projects, and phases.

Integrates with OpenAI to generate content.

Stores everything permanently (5-year memory).

Rebuilds context and handles cascading updates.

Supports collaboration (invite editors).

Exports documents asynchronously (PDF/Word/JSON).

📦 Backend Tech Stack You’ll Use
Component	Tool
Framework	FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
Database	PostgreSQL 16+ with pgvector
Caching & Queue	Redis 7+
Async Tasks	Celery
AI Models	OpenAI (gpt-4-turbo-preview)
Embedding	text-embedding-3-small
Deployment	Docker + AWS (EKS, RDS, ElastiCache)
CI/CD & IaC	GitHub Actions + Terraform

🏗️ Backend Development Plan (Step-by-Step)
✅ Phase 1: Project & User Management
Set up FastAPI project structure.

Build API for:

User registration/login (JWT).

Create/view/update/delete Projects.

Invite collaborators (Editor role).

Use PostgreSQL schema:

sql
Copy
Edit
User, Project, ProjectMembers, Phase, PhaseDrafts
✅ Phase 2: 14-Phase Engine
Create a table: Phase(id, project_id, phase_number, title, prompt, status)

Each phase should store:

Input questions

User responses

AI-generated drafts

Version history

API endpoints:

/projects/{id}/phases/{n}/start

/projects/{id}/phases/{n}/edit

/projects/{id}/phases/{n}/reconstruct-context

✅ Phase 3: RAG + AI Integration
Use pgvector to store embedding of every phase’s content.

Use text-embedding-3-small to embed phase summaries.

On each request, retrieve past relevant phases using semantic search.

Send context + user input to gpt-4-turbo-preview for generation.

✅ Phase 4: Cascade Update Logic
Track dependency tree between phases.

If a user edits Phase 3:

Flag Phases 4–14 as STALE.

Store in Phase.status = 'STALE'

Let frontend show warnings for outdated sections.

✅ Phase 5: Draft Versioning
Every edit should save the previous version:

Use PhaseDrafts(phase_id, version, content, created_at)

Allow rollback if needed.

✅ Phase 6: Export System (Async via Celery)
User hits Export → generate final document in background.

Use Celery with Redis as the broker.

Tasks:

Fetch all phases

Merge & format into PDF, Word, and JSON

Save file location to database

✅ Phase 7: Auth & Roles
Implement JWT-based OAuth2.0:

Refresh + access tokens.

Define roles:

Owner: Can edit/delete, manage users

Editor: Can edit but not delete or manage

✅ Phase 8: State Persistence & 5-Year Memory
Store everything:

Inputs

Drafts

Chat logs (optional)

Export files

Use PostgreSQL for all long-term memory.

🛡️ Security (Must-Haves)
TLS 1.3 (assume HTTPS via AWS load balancer).

AES-256 encryption (use managed RDS + backups).

Validate every request and apply role-based access.

🧪 What to Test
Phase jumping + context fallback.

Phase editing + cascade behavior.

RAG retrieval accuracy.

Export generation.

User/role enforcement.
