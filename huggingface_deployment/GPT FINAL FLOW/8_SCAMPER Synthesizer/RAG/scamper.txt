SCAMPER
The SCAMPER method helps you generate ideas for new products and services by encouraging you 
to ask seven different types of questions, which will help you understand how you can innovate and 
improve existing products, services, problems and ideas. SCAMPER is an acronym formed from the 
abbreviation of: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify (Also magnify and minify), Put to another use, 
Eliminate, and Reverse. SCAMPER is a lateral thinking technique which challenges the status quo 
and helps you explore new possibilities.
SCAMPER refers to a series of thought sparkers or provocations which help you to innovate on an 
existing product, service or situation by looking through different lenses . There are seven 
provocation lenses in the SCAMPER method: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify (Also Magnify 
and Minify), Put to another use, Eliminate, and Reverse.SCAMPERS C A M P E R

Best practice: How to use SCAMPER
First, take an existing product or service. It could be an existing product, service or idea which 
you want to improve or which could be a great starting point for future development.
Then, simply go down the list and ask questions regarding each of the seven elements. Please 
see our step-by-step guide below.

Apply the questions to values, beneﬁts, services, touch points, product attributes, pricing, 
markets and essentially any other related aspect you might be able to think of that has relevance 
to your ideation needs.
Look at the answers that you came up with. Do any of the answers stand out as viable 
solutions? Could you use any of them to create a new product, or develop an existing one? 
Take the good ideas and explore them further.•

McDonald’s would come to be a larger-than-life household name; it may seem hard to see in the 21st 
century, but the philosophy behind its ‘formula’ revolutionised the old style of restaurant experience.

components are the most important ones. Think about changing part or all of the current situation 
or product. Alternatively, distort the product in an unusual way.
