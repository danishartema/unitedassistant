long winded topic today, if you didn't read it in the Facebook group, it's a long one. So the only hack you need is mastering digital marketers customer avatar Canvas to write copy that sells, with examples of verifying ad copy on Facebook. So, our agency has been a certified Digital Marketer partner since like 2017, one of the first tools we ever learned was the customer avatar Canvas, we use that thing relentlessly in absolutely everything we do. So I'm going to be showing some examples of how you can use it to create Facebook ads. But we would also use it on landing pages, we use it in emails, kind of use it everywhere that we go, the thing I like about Facebook is that we get to verify if this copy that we dream up is actually resonating with the audience. Alrighty, so the things we're going to cover. So I'm going to do a little little recap, this is one of the one of the things that marketers and business owners are guilty of, is talking too much about the product features. And I know what Ryan Deiss if if anyone's watched Ryan Deiss is training on the customer after canvas, a lot of this is gonna be recapping it, and then I'm gonna be showing you how to apply it. But one of the things that businesses and marketers get hung up on is just talking too much about features, and not about the customers transformation. However, it's we don't want to completely neglect features, we do want to talk about features as well. So I'm just gonna do a quick recap, recap on that. And then we're gonna talk about the customer avatar Canvas. So I'm going to be talking about how to fill out that tool. And it may be a case right now that you're filling it out, but not to its full potential. And so I'm gonna show you exactly how to fill it out. And then I'm going to take that Canvas, I'm gonna show you a real example of a real client that we work with where we built a customer avatar canvas, and then I'm gonna show you how we break it down and start creating ads with these things. And then how we go and launch some ads on Facebook to verify if people are digging what we're throwing down. Okay, so the first thing, I hope that everybody would know what their value proposition is. Right? So this is, this is kind of the first thing, and it's the easiest one to figure out. So the value proposition is basically what makes your product or service attractive to your customers, why do they go to you instead of somebody else? Okay, so this is like a recap of hopefully, you know, what differentiates you from your competitors? But if you don't, you can, we're gonna walk through it right now. And as I go through these, you can start to think which one of these areas am I competing on? am I competing on price? Like, do people come to me because they can get it from for cheaper than a competitor. So like, maybe you have some crazy manufacturing connections, and you're able to manufacture things for really cheap, and you've been offered a lower price. Or maybe you're like in the E commerce world, if you're a direct to consumer brand, who competes on price, because you take out a middle person, like you see those big mattress companies like purple, and all these ones, nd they no longer are going to wholesale model where they wholesale to retailers, they're just selling directly to the consumer. So they have more margins, less overhead, all this fun stuff. Or maybe you're actually competing on design. So this would definitely be like a product centric feature. Is your design higher quality than your competitors? Is it on trend? And then maybe this is very common one is function and innovation. Does your product or service make life easier or better for your customers? So maybe you're just competing on a better way to live and saving you a lot of hassle? Is it more practical than your competitors products? Does it help save time? Is it convenient? The last one is time and relevance. So you might be competing, selling face masks during a pandemic. That's kind of like a fad. So we would be competing based on time and how relevant it is to the economy right now. Things like selling political campaign T shirts would be another example of something that's based on time and relevancy. So right now you can kind of probably know where does my product or service fit. Like, if it's like function, like maybe you're an agency like we are, and we're not selling products, and we're selling like really awesome services, we'd be competing on the best kind of function because we're like really good at selling ecommerce products. So to kind of think about that right now, we're not gonna spend too much time here, but I'm going to touch on it again in a second. So let's look at the customer avatar canvas and discuss how to fill out this dream dream tool. Okay, so with the customer avatar canvas, this is what it looks like. You can go and download it. I think there's a like customer avatar Canvas workbook. I think in the 30 day kickstart Ryan actually linked to it as an extracurricular thing. I remember seeing that as an extracurricular thing. And I was like, No, this this is an extracurricular this is like everything. And when I talked to people in our accountability group, this comes up a lot and which is why I decided to talk about it today is that this is the tool we need. We don't want to start building marketing funnels and emails and landing pages and ads without understanding our customers transformation. And that's what we're trying trying to pin down here. So you want to fill up the customer after canvas with the qualities of your best customers. So you may look at your different customer segments that you sell to right now, this is an opportunity to put the intent up to the world self fulfilling prophecy, we're going to fill this out with the customers we want more of, and not just your everyday customer, but the ones you want to attract more of. And if you have more than one ideal target customer, you're gonna complete this for each segment. So as you build it, like I hope everyone would know this by now. But if you're gonna build out a campaign, you have very different customer segments, we got to get hyper specific to that customer segments pain point, if it's going to resonate through digital marketing. So we want to build one of these for each segment. Okay. And then you want to, when you're filling this out, you want to start with your most obvious answers that define your customer and put them in this document. One thing I've known for sure other people would hear of who have used it would know, you can't really fill out everything in this tool. So you might want to set up like a side Google Word documents. And here's the thing about filling this thing out right now, if we've never invested in ads, or ran campaigns, or you don't know our customer, we're presuming a lot. We're assuming a lot about our customer, which is kind of like a frustrating thing. When you're filling it out. You're like, I don't know, all these things will my customer. But I'm going to give you tips on how to go find out these things. But we just want to start with assumptions. Let's presume we know who our avatar is. And then over time, we're going to go and run ads, we're going to get some good insights, we're going to adapt and tweak this as we get to know our customer really well. Okay, so the way that you fill it out, is you start with the center and bottom sections. So you'd start with avatar, demographics, interests, key purchases, wants and aspirations, right. And we'll go through each of those. And sorry, and then I'm going to get to the before and after stuff after. So let's just start filling this out. And this is actually based on a real client who spoken on a lot of stages and events with us because we've done such awesome work together. And we've worked together for many years. So this customer target segment or target customer segment here. This is a company that sells wakeboard gear wakeboards wake fest, they also sell like paddle boards, but that'd be a different customer segment. But when we're thinking just about the wakeboard side of the business, we want to think about one avatar. So who is the target customer segment, it's anybody who buys wakeboards, but we can get more narrow. So first you want identify the segment. In this one here, like it could be if you think about who buys wakeboards. It's sponsored pros, it's teenagers. But a lot of the time, it's like that, Darrell, the guy with all the disposable income, who's the famous guy at the lake, who buys based on what his kids are telling him to buy. Okay, so I've picked one customer segment, there's also like the pros, and the loungers, and all these kinds of things. But I pick the guy with the disposable income, who's a customer we want more of. Right, so then what you're going to do. So basically, you're going to identify this customer segments. And the whole idea with this avatar is that this entire customer segment has a lot in common. So this avatar profile is trying to capture what all these lake that barrels have in common. And then you're going to so you have your customer segment, it's the lake dad. And then you're going to tack on a make believe named after the customer segment, keep it catchy. So it's memorable, and this avatar is leaked out there. So basically, you pick your customer segment, that's the first part like that's, and then just tack on a name to make it memorable. And do not overthink this one, it should take two seconds to do. All right, so then the next section here, so you got your customer segment all figured out. Now you're going to jot down as many demographics and interests that are relevant to your business. So in the old version of the customer avatar Canvas way back and four years ago, DM, it had listed things like age, gender, number of kids didn't always mean like 90% of the time, it didn't matter to a business about those things. So they've kind of reframed it, where you would just put in the demographics and interests that are relevant to your customer segment. So what is like a common age common gender, common marital status number native children? Where do they live most of the time? Are they urban or rural? Are they Canadian, American, those kinds of things? Do they have a common occupation and job title? Do they have a common annual income and disposable income? What is the level of education if that thing matters? Okay, so that's kind of for him for lake that, Darrell? Yeah, he's aged between 35 and 55. He has two children aged five to 25 lives in an urban center, but owns a lake lot has an established career with 100k Plus salary. So this is the guy and then the next thing that we would want to include in this demographic section is a quote that sums up their feelings related to the problem and goal mostly related to your product. So if they were going through Instagram and they saw a quote, which one would they like and share with their friends? That's kind of how I think about it. So there we actually nail down an awesome quote for this lake that Darrell, which they would take a joke they always tell it the lake is my boat runs on gas, not Thanks. So everyone's like, Thanks for the ride, Darrell. And then Darryl knows it costs $400 A day in gas to cruise around the boat. So kind of a funny thing there. And you know, you were just really trying to paint a picture of who this guy is what he thinks is funny. And as we start creating content, we really want to understand who he is. And then what brands or influencers do they follow or engage with, this is a really important one. Because when you start creating Facebook ads, which I'm going to get to in a second, and I hope everyone has some really hard hitting Facebook questions, because I'm gonna jump into Facebook ads in a second here like a little bit later, but you're gonna want to build interest audiences. And you want to build interest audience based on where Darryl is hanging out. So who does he follow? What trade shows does he go to? So I put here that he follows barbecue brands, watches, the fishing network attends boating trade shows, okay, so you really want to start to paint a picture of these things. And as I said, it's not verified. Now, right now we're kind of if we don't have the data, we're guessing, and we're gonna go out there and verify. That's what this topical call is about is like presuming and then and then verified, okay. So put whatever brands or influencers or where else they get their information, books, blogs, forums, conferences, and we're going to be using this when creating ads. So this side about where they hang out, we're going to use those to build interest audiences, the part where we outline their before and after states, we're going to use that to write copy to speak to lake that barrels transformational state. Okay, so skip the key purchase drivers, I should have probably warned everyone to like bring this sheet and fill it out as we go along. But you can rewatch this. So skip the key purchase drivers for now jumped down to frustrations and fears down here. And these are the problems that customers want to move away from. So they're having some issues in their life, and they want to kind of get away from that. And these are things like what keeps them up at night? What annoys and or frustrates them? What challenges do they face on a daily basis, big and small? Who are what is standing in the way of their success and happiness? What are some key systems in their life and job that frequently fail? What's something they're focused or forced to interact with? It's difficult to manage or understand and what feature or lack of features do they regularly complain about in related to the products and services you sell. So the frustrations and fears for like that they're all wants to make sure their kids have the best quality products that are on trend and safe. That would be something for sure. Doesn't like cheap gear that needs to be replaced prides themselves on everything to do with the lake, and would dread not having fun with the family. Okay, so there's some like frustrations and fears there. And then you move to the next one wants and aspirations. And the questions here that you'd be asking are what are the good things that like that Darrell wants to strive towards and add to his life? So this would be something like, what do they want for themselves? What do they want for the people around them? Like their family, friends, coworkers? What do they aspire to be? What goals have they set for themselves? What values do they hold dear? And what are their secret desires? So over here, we have one son aspirations wants a happy family moments and memories wants the Lake community to have the best time to neighbors, friends, relatives, everyone aspires to create the dream getaway to retirement Haven values, family legacy tradition, outdoors activities, these kinds of things. Then we go to the next one. So this one is the key purchase drivers. So with key purchase drivers here. Why would this avatar buy? Like what is the motive behind the purchase? And what is the most important stuff. So this would be things like must have features in your product? That would be something like your value proposition. That's why I wanted you to think about your value proposition, because that might be something that you would include as a key purchase driver. And is it their expectation of your service? If you're b2b, or b2c? Is it quality expectation? That's another value proposition item. They care about function and design. Are there any no deal killers? Like what is just going to be the reason they say no in the buying process? You want to preempt those objections in your landing page and product page copy. So if you if you talk to your customers all the time, then there's always like this one barrier that they can't get past. We're going to create content to preempt that objection right on the landing page. And are there any other additional stakeholders and decision makers that influence lake that Darrell finally making the transaction so the key purchase drivers, their kids guide all the products that they buy? The kids are pulling on dad's leg and saying we need this this this brand that brand. Kids have the wishlist are taught and dad has the wallet. So they need to look good at the lake. This is a key purchase driver. So styling options are important. They need to be the trendiest brand. If they're going to be like this famous Lake dad, they want everything looking pristine and proper. And a common objection like this, just an example. Like this is a real real objection in our world working with this client is that a common objection is that some weak vets best don't meet safety regulations like they're not actually certified under the like the safety regulatory board, but they make your flow they just like not quite as like verified as a life jacket with the big neck piece. They're kind of like a life jacket without the neck piece. And they look really cool. They have like, they look like Garrett's shirt, like flowers and like really cool patterns and stuff like that on. All right, so it's important to understand these things here. And then this is the big one, this is probably my favorite thing. And this is this is how we're going to start creating the ad copy. And everything is understanding the customer's aspirational state. So this is where you fill out the before and after stage, how will your product transform your customer for the better, and what is your customer's life like before using your products, and what is it like after. So right now they're in this like miserable state, and they have this deep pain, deep passion, they're going nowhere. And your product is a vehicle to get to them to this ultimate transformation that's going to change their life. And this is where we are trying to define that transformation. And a good line, this was one of this is from Ryan Deiss, right in that training, but people don't buy products, they buy transformations. So very easy to understand what these examples, people don't buy gym equipment, they buy, how their bodies going to transform. So you wouldn't want to spend all the time in the world, talking about the metallics that are used in your gym equipment, you want to talk about that amazing body that you're gonna get by using the product and how easy it is to do. People buy jewelry and apparel to transform their appearance or about elevate their status. So again, we don't want to spend maybe if people are allergic to jewelry, that might be an important thing to talk about, like non allergenic or whatever it is. But really, we want to be speaking to the transformation, get this jewelry, you're gonna look really cool, and everyone's gonna love you. And right now your customer is in an undesirable before state and your product solves their problem, you remove their pain, and you provide entertainment or make them successful, ultimately make them happy. So a good product delivers the after state your avatar wants, like your this is all about like product market fit. And if you want to be a successful business, your product has to deliver on the brand promise, if you will, they're gonna say hey, we know how miserable you are. And we're gonna get you over here, if you can deliver on that. That's an amazing product. And good marketing articulates that transformation. Okay, good key insights to remember. So let's look at the before state so your this is your customers current, undesirable state state, what does your avatar have now that they don't want this should be relevant to your product? So if we look right now at Lake that Daryl he has outdated, uncool, broken down gear does not have the trendiest stuff in that garage. And the feel state, how does that thing make the avatar feel in the before state? So he's embarrassed and guilty? Like he's embarrassed to be seen with this equipment and is guilty that his kids have to use that. And you know, if he's embarrassed, the kids are gonna be embarrassed, he's just feeling not so good. And how does this affect the average day in your avatars life? Well, now Daryl is not going to go to the lake often. And he's not spending quality time with the family anymore, even though those are the things that he's aspiring to have. And what is the status this often a good way to remember status is like, how does how do other like dads or how do people in that community view dad like that, Darrell, as a result, if he's not going to the lake often, and he's not spending time with his family, and he's embarrassed and guilty, he becomes a reclusive neighbor. Everyone's gonna look at him as this recluse like, hey, remember, when leaked out there and moved here a year ago? I haven't seen him in like six months, what a recluse all because he has this terrible equipment. And then the good versus evil state is when you're thinking about, like, what kind of evil is out there in the world that your product is going to product or service is going to help overcome. So in this one, it could be like, hey, because he's a recluse neighbor, he's not going out there. His kids don't get outside. And they grew up stuck on their iPhones and Tiktok. All because they didn't find any weight gear from from us. And then quite easy to come up with the after state because we're just contrasting these things. But basically, we look at this what is your avatar have in there after state? How is your customer transformed? So now he has top quality gear that's trendy and sexy? Everybody's like, super impressed when they see it. How does that make him feel? And the actor state was proud to show off. He's empowered. He's excited. How does this improve an average day in your amateurs? Life? Well, now we're at the lake every single weekend bonding with family and friends. And it's everything's awesome. And this How is the status improved? This is a guy at the lake everyone wants to hang out with or be. He's like the lake that superhero. All because he leveled up this week, wait for your game. And the good receival kids are healthy, athletic, and they're spending time outside, they're not on their phones. And it leads to more people being healthy too, because they're bringing their friends out and they're causing a good chain of optimism and improve habits. All right, so that's how you fill out the customer avatar canvas. And I can tell you right now, if you work with a copywriter, like somebody who writes copy for your business, handle, miss, fill this out and be like, here you go, go write some ads and emails and landing page copy. And the truth is, like I said, right now we're doing a lot of presuming that we know who they are, we do want to get to know like that Darrell a lot more. So we can verify that these things are true. So how to get the right customer insights to complete this worksheet, you may ask? You want to definitely at some point, survey your customer base, or talk with your existing customers? And ask them the questions on here. Where do you hang out? What do you where do you go for information? Why did you buy this product? What did you like about it this versus the competitors? How was your life transformed as a result? Are you spending more time to like because of it like these kinds of things? And that's a dream scenario, like you shouldn't be doing that at some point. I personally at our agency, I send out questionnaires to our clients all the time. And I'll have like four questions. Why did you buy from us than that, and I get some really good hyper engaged responses that I use in our ad copy later, which is really nice. And I'll show you how to do that in a sec. Or, or if you don't, if you don't serve a talk to existing customers, maybe you pull from personal experience, like you built this business, right. So you may already be familiar with your ideal customer, and what they need from you. Because you build this business, you've been talking to customers for a long time. So you might not even talk to anyone, you might just fill it out, because you have some ideas about it. Or perhaps you are the ideal customer, like you build this business because you love this thing. So if so, it's a place to start making assumptions. But we don't want to rely on only your input, you're going to need data from others to verify your assumptions. When we start verifying assumptions, we need a sample pool. We need like 50 people or 100 people that have given us their input. And we're going to look at trends amongst all those responses to make verified assumptions. Okay, so if your assumption alone is actually probably scary, because you're thinking like the best case scenario all the time. And then the other thing, this is one of my favorite things that everybody could go do right now. Go collect testimonials and reviews from your customers. So just go ask them for Tesla's reviews. And if you don't have those, look at your competitors reviews to see which features the customers value the most. This is a lot like Ryan Levesque, he teaches like the Ask method, he did a workshop with them. And he's basically going through all the testimonials and he's looking for the hyper engaged responses, not the one liners like awesome product, love it. It's awesome product I tried it on didn't know it was made from this fabric, I can sleep better at night as a result. Oh, like when people are just pouring out the value. Those are the ones that you want to document and listen to. And honestly, I can tell you right now, digital marketing will fall flat if you're not connecting with your audience. So doing these things right now is essential, so that your ads stand out. And you get higher click through rates, higher purchases, higher everything. And another thing this is another digital marketer recommendation that I saw in the workshop, it's do a Google search. And I've done this and it's works really well. You hear a few search terms to get you started. Top Books for Lake debts. So you put top books for whoever your customer avatar is best customer avatar conferences, top customer avatar blogs, best customer avatar Facebook groups. So now you can go and find out where they're spending their time. And you can use those as interest audiences, you can use those as places to connect with avatar, you can use those as places to present your offer to people that you want to sell to. Alright, and then you also want to talk to people who fit this customer avatar profile, you could do this today, go look up Lake dad, Facebook groups, and then jump and jump into these forums, communities and groups and have conversation ask them to fill out the form. Right? Like you want to know, like, where do they go for information, what frustrates them about their current product options? And just I actually I'm working with a client right now who's did like a million dollars in a year in sales in E commerce. And I was like, whoa, what are you guys doing? That's awesome. He told me like they sell products to a specific kind of mom. And they joined all these groups and just had moms and dads actually so it was a parents groups that he just went into and said Hey everyone, I'm thinking about doing this product. Here's what I was thinking like you can do Would you would you like it if it was like this, this or this and you're just getting real time feedback from that customer segment. And this is called the insider strategy. A lot of E commerce brands do it but not even just ecommerce service businesses where you make your target customer part of the product creation process, and they buy in because they're part of your like insider community. And by the time you get to the end of that process, it's like Oh, thanks everyone. I love you so much. Where you can preorder it and because you participate we're gonna give you 10% off and next thing you know you sold out your product before you had to manufacture it. There's there's a book called The Pumpkin Plan by Michael monochromator like never say last name he wrote like Profit First clockwork he talks about this insider strategy a lot and really resonated when I heard him talk about it. Michael McCalla wits anybody He's like he's a prominent authors, lots of books. And then next, like, you want to get as much as you can on that initial page, as I show you. And then you want to keep brainstorming as you collect new insights. So you're going to use this for ads, emails and landing page, landing pages. And it's going to help you verify your assumptions through this coaching program. So it doesn't end here. I've known I've ran lots of like, a probably over 100 workshops, with businesses, helping them with their customer, Avatar, Canvas, their CV, J's, all these kinds of things. And this is the biggest problem is that people look at the customer avatar canvas, and they're like, I get why I need to do it. But I'm like, my brain is like breaking down right now. Because they don't know the answers to these questions. So they feel really frustrated, because they wish they knew the answers to these things. And they don't feel comfortable putting in loose answers that are not verified, which makes sense. So all we're trying to do right now is get as much information as we can from those resources, and build this initial like prototype. And then as we run ads, you get to start to verify it, I'm gonna be showing you that next is how we do it. So we can start to verify which message messages are resonating, and we can continually update this document. Okay, so the next section here, it's putting your customer after campus to work on Facebook. And this is the last section what time's right now because I was really, I could show you like the backend of Facebook, I can do we can do whatever. But after I show you this part, it's open for questions. We do like super hyper advanced Facebook advertising. So if you have questions about that, we can go as deep as you want to go. But this is how you put your customer avatar canvas to work on Facebook. So when you run, when you run a Facebook campaign, the last thing you would ever want to do is write one ad, or even two. And what before you ever start advertising on Facebook, you always want to presume that you're going to do better. So even if you have an ad, that worked really well, we got to say it's not good enough. And I know I can do better. And the process goes a little bit like this, like you're, you're gonna want like if you're launching a Facebook ad campaign for the first time, you don't know which one of these aspirational attributes is going to resonate the most with your target customer. If you think about the customer value journey, every single stage aware, engage, subscribe, convert site, send apt get promote, you're trying to advance your customer with an offer. And then when I say offer, I don't mean a discount, I mean an ask. So you're asking them to do something, hey, we're on Facebook, you saw an ad, come check out our new product catalog. Always check out the product catalog want to download it and send it to a friend? Oh, you want to download it you want 10% off your first time buying something from this catalog? Oh, do you want to buy something else from the kind of like you just keep asking along the journey. And that's how you advance into the relationship. And the problem is we don't know when we start a campaign what our customer is gonna say yes or no to? If they say yes, who if they say no? Gonna go back to the drawing board and ask them something else. So it's a very important key to remember is that we want to speak to like different aspirational states. So the way that you would do it, you have your customer avatar Canvas filled out, you want to create a little chart like this, you should do three to five angles. And I put four examples. But you could put like five, you could put 10. And with each angle, we're speaking to different aspirational statements over here. So angle one might be like, Hey, we know that like that Daryl wants to make incredible memories with the family. So we're gonna do an ad angle. That's all about how you transformed like this drab life he was living with his kids to like, everybody's making these memories together. And legacies in that to that next angle isn't just about family memories, it's about being a lake hero. Like show up with the lake give everyone a fun time. And you'll attract everybody, everyone who wants to be like you, you're gonna be the coolest guy on the block. The next one is more about that good versus evil. So give your kids something to do that's way better than Tik Tok. That could be like, copy in an app, give your kids something to do this better way better than Tik Tok, that's gonna get some parents attention. Because it's deeper than just the product features. It's about that aspirational state. And I'm dead certain that that's a big pain point for a lot of parents. And then angle for this is like now we're talking about the have over here, the best technology equals the best performance. So you can actually start talking about the product features and the value proposition stuff too. But I think as Ryan Deiss has, like taught and I've learned this from him is people get hung up just promoting features all the time. And they're not talking about how it's going to make my day better, how it's going to make my family life better, how it's going to make my community better, and all these things. So this is what you would do as you brainstorm all of your angles in one area. This is a good way to start planning your ad campaign before you go and just hop into Facebook and start creating a bunch of stuff. Because you're going to be scrambling in there. Because you're going to be trying to figure out what the technology and like where does everything go and this and that it's better to have this where it's like, this is my ad strategy. I don't care about the technology yet. And once you have this figured out, then you just gotta go into Facebook and make it happen. And for each of these, these, this is what is required for a Facebook ad, you have to have a headline. So this is where if you're linking to like a landing page, this is like that, that big headline that says, like, learn more, and the CTA or their body copy is like, the full, like direct response copy, or whatever it is, it's like the big paragraph before the link or the product or whatever. The description shows up below the headline. And it's just this little like blurb. And sometimes it doesn't show up on on certain platforms, or like on mobile, and all this kind of stuff. So it's the least important is the description one. And then this is an important piece at the end, you want to create, you want to assign about four images to each angle. So when I think about an angle, it's like the story that I'm telling about a specific pain point or use case for my target customer. And then I'm going to attach four different images with it. Because if I only put one image with it, it might have been the image that flopped or it might have been the copy that flocked. But if I put four images with this copy, and two of them are performing, then I know what my winning combos are, if all four flop, I got some that it's probably the copy. And the images, combos is not good. So you want do you want to verify with multiple images per copy. And I know for certain through tons of experience that it's like I always try and pick my winner before I launch a campaign. I'm like, I think it's gonna be best copy with this image. And I'm always wrong, I was gonna see Garrett smiling and laughing over there. But usually it's like, whoa, this image, I barely even added that one, I just added it because it was like I needed for. And this one's just like taking off. So you do want to run these kinds of experiments. Right. And then the other thing that I'm going to quickly mention, I didn't want to, I didn't want to go into like too much too, deep of complicating things, but it might actually simplify things. When we so there's two things going on here, we're talking to the aspirational state with each angle. But there's their specific offer attribute that we can include in here, too. So right now, this is like the storytelling part of the ad. But each offer also has an attribute that compels people to say yes. Okay, and the offer attributes that compel people to say, yes, there's four of them. And I have an acronym that's easy for you to remember them. The acronym is TBI F, think Buddha, it's Friday. And the first attribute is transactional. So the first attribute might be based on a discount. So it might be like, if let's let's use a winter jackets for an example for these for if you were selling winter jackets, when would you use a transactional attribute, you'd use it at the end of the season. It's like May, all winter jackets must go 70% Off. Right, so you're using a transactional attribute. And it can be like making credible memories with the family. Now you can save 70% off. So you're still using the aspirational state from the customer avatar canvas with an offer attribute in there. Now the next one, so the first one was transactional. The next one is a brand attribute. And this is where customers are going to not buy into the transactional component, like a gift with purchase a discount or all these things they're buying into the vision and the mission of the brand and the lifestyle that they want to buy into. So a good example for a winter jacket might be like, you know, I see North Face ads where they're like, be a mountain person but live in the city live this lifestyle, or like worn by the American Olympic mountain climbing team. And people are buying into the story of that product. So it would be like be a lake hero by using the same gear that wake America wake Timor uses. Right. So you're you're using like the aspirational state messaging with the offer attribute. The next one down the list. So with a TV, the next one is AI influence. And this is where you're using a third party to persuade the customer on your behalf. So obviously, obviously influencer campaigns like you would go talk to micro influencers or you know, brand like these collaborative campaigns you can now do on Facebook, you could find like micro influencers right through Facebook and like present a campaign for them to partner on which is really cool. But it could also be like a celebrity endorsement, which maybe is out of reach for now. But the third thing that's an influence attribute that is very attainable for all of us is customer testimonials. And one of our angles needs to be a customer testimonial. So we have to use that in one. We have a ton of success with using testimonials in ADS. And then you want those testimonials to be everywhere ads, emails, product pages, landing pages, and they're good influence attributes for that guide people to say yes, the last one, which is incredibly important. And it was kind of like about that value proposition stuff. It's functional attribute. So, actually, to recap, so the first one was transaction, you might be doing like a 70% off and a winter sale. Brand is like buying into the Olympic team that we were these winter jackets, influences like, hey, Jennifer Aniston wore this jacket, you should get it too, or a customer testimonial. The functional attribute is specifically talking about how this technology or how this product is going to make your life better. And with functional attributes, there's usually a trigger event. So it starts raining right now, I need an umbrella. Right? If it's a rainy season, you might do an add about function. If it's like the winter jacket example, it's the start of winter, it's gonna be super cold, we have the warmest code on the planet for you. Or like, you know, you can get really specific to the trigger event. It's like, Hey, did you know that or that's like, Hey, everyone, how are you like zoom conference calls going, we want to up your game with this new technology. So now they're it's not just like something that they buy every day. It's like an innovative thing. It's a new thing for them. But it's specific to a trigger event that we're all at home using zoom and all these kinds of things. So it would have been nice if I had a chart in here recapping those, but I saw some people taking notes. So TBI F transactional brand influence function, you can you don't have to use one at a time, you can have an ad that speaks to the aspirational state and includes all four. So it could be like, you know, but were the jackets that our hero American team wore. And you will be a hero to and just for a limited time buy one get a tuk for free or that's Canadian term for winter hat, get a winter hat for free. That's a transactional attribute. It was worn by the Olympic team that's an influence attribute. And functional, it's the warmest one you're gonna get this season. So you can have like all four and one. And that, like I said, though, the the key is we don't know which one our customer is gonna say yes to. And that's what we're trying to verify. So we're gonna test different attributes with these aspirational states. All righty. Okay, and then this is the last slide I have. And then we can open up the floor. And like, if anyone's doing this stuff, we can we can get as deep as you want to go. But now it's time to go and verify like we've built out our ads, you got our eye for attributes, we got all these good things in there. Now we're going to go in and set up an ad in Facebook, and you're going to set your ad objective. So if you're if you're doing lead generation, like your coach or business like selling to other businesses, you're going to set up your conversion for lead generation. And it's probably going to be like an ad with a link. If you're in E commerce, it's probably gonna be a purchase objective. Right? And you might do like, carousel ads, like there's lots of different ads you could be doing. And then after that, you this is an important piece that I don't have the answer for to For everyone here at once. But we can like jump into it as like a q&a kind of thing. You just set target KPIs, and this comes in with like your girls scorecard. This will be a girl scorecard thing. And if you're doing lead generation as a b2b company, it's going to be cost per lead, it is definitely going to be cost per often. If you're doing some VSL funnel, you're gonna be looking at like, how much does it cost per opt in. For E commerce, it could be like purchases. And that's your most important KPI. But you need to monitor all the metrics along the funnel, and not just those. So you're going to want to know when you're advertising on Facebook, no matter what business you are, you need to know CPM cost per 1000 reach. If your cost per 1000 reaches really high, that means your ads not resonating with anyone. So you've got to fix the copy and the creative. The next one you're gonna wanna know is the click through rate. And that's an another important one. And you usually want that to be less than like, or you want it to be one to 3% if it's higher than that phenomenal, but if it's like less than 1%, it starts to get a little bit red flags, and cost per acquisition, ultimately, how much Ukraine customers for because you gotta, as you start running your ads on Facebook, you got to you got to offset that investment. So it's important to dial in how much you're spending per customer that you acquire. And then so you've done that kind of set up the objective, you know, your KPIs, now you're gonna launch your five ad angles, each with four images against eight to 30 audiences. And this could be cold, which means like, open, so I don't think I meant to put open there. But it's because all these are cold ads. But so yeah, this would be open ads, where you actually don't even assign an interest audience or a look alike audience. There's no targeted audience in there. It's just open to everyone. And in that scenario, you're kind of lean on Facebook's genius. They know what type of buyer wants your product. So you're kind of leaving it up to them as part of the experiment. The next thing you're gonna want to split testing part of your audience's interests. And it gets really expensive that you could see where we're doing five ad angles for images, that's four ads per angle so far, as soon as we start adding on More audiences, those are just more ad sets. So like the ideal world, you would run five ad angles with four images with 30 audiences. But that would cost you like 10 grand in 10 days or something like that, if you're doing a $10 today, but we can we in the q&a, we can talk more about that because I've we've run tons and tons of these, and we kind of have a good idea of the price per number. And then you're gonna run each ad set for $10 a day. Remember, each ad set has four images, so each ad set has four ads. And depending on how many audiences it's like that times the amount of audiences and your number of ad sets will be equivalent to the number of angles times I said number, suppose the number, your number of ad sets will be equivalent to the number of angles times the number of audiences. And then what you do is you go and run, this is like the fun part, it gets exhilarating, I can tell you that much. As you go in run, each ad set at $10 per day. And what you're trying to do is verify the winners, you're trying to know which ad copy resonated with these audiences the most. And with Facebook, you don't touch anything for the first four days at all. When you start running these ads, they go into this learning phase. It's like Facebook's Garden of Eden, where they're trying to connect your message with the right type of people based on whatever you set up. And you'll see the KPIs skew like crazy in those four days, where it's like ad dollars per lead $10 per lead 75. And then it kind of evens out by the 10 day mark or four day mark, sorry. And then after four days, what we're going to be doing is turning off ad sets that are outside of the KPI. And this is where it's not as scary anymore, because you're wanting to reduce that budget. So you start chopping off all these ad sets that aren't performing. And the way it would work is like say you were you say you were doing lead generation. And you set your target, you set your target KPI for lead gen at $10 per lead. And that's a pretty, pretty reasonable number $10 per lead. And what you would do after four days is look at all your ad sets. And if there's an ad set that did not have, that did not acquire a lead for $10, like it was like $20 per lead, we'll get rid of all those right away. Those ones are just enough budget, but you're going to be left with some really high performers, you're gonna be left ones with whatever like $3 per octave $8 profit, which is exciting, we want to keep it under $10. And then you're going to basically do this daily until you're left with some top performers that are under that target KPI. And then what you do is you duplicate that exact ad how it is, and you'd like 10x to spend. So, if you're spending the theory behind that is basically, if you're running an ad at $10 a day, and you're getting a lead at $10 per lead, that means you're just getting one lead per day, $10 per lead $10 per day, you're getting one lead per day, that's not a very fast way for Facebook to learn and optimize for $10 leads. So you what you want to do is say, Hey, I got an ad that's performing at $8 per day, you want to duplicate that and run it at like $80 per day 10 times that. Because you're gonna, you're gonna start getting 10 leads per day, and Facebook's gonna learn really quickly, which people they should get the ad to, you're speeding up Facebook's learning. And honestly, truthfully, you have to do that no matter what, whether you spend it in 10 days or 100 days, it's the same thing, Facebook's gonna do the same amount of learning, depending on the amount of data it's collecting. And then what you would do is so and then say it seemed like things could be flying after this experiment, you could like, well, I got all these leads all these customers so awesome. But we would never want to presume that we have the best ad. So we would set up a separate side campaign in Facebook, that's like a sandbox. And this is where we would go and test out new angles, where we're like, oh, I just like learn so much insights from this process. But I have some new ideas for add angles, you would go put those add angles in this like sandbox and run it at $10 per day. And you'd run it against a few audiences as well. And if there's some winners, you would duplicate that and put it into the other campaign with all the rest of them. But that's kind of the idea with and you know, like we're so we're using the customer avatar canvas. That's how we're going to resonate with these ads. And then we're running some some ad spend to verify which ones were resonating the most. And then through that process, guess what? Now we know which copy was resonating with our target customer. We can use that copy from the winning ads on our landing pages in our emails all over our website.
