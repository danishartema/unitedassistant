All right.

Now let's look at the different types of triggering events. Because, by the way, the word triggering is incredibly difficult to say. I'm sure I've screwed it up, like triggering. All right, we're looking at the different types of triggering events to help categorize it and make it easier for you to brainstorm some for your particular business. All right, so there are really three types of triggering events that I have identified. The first is internal Okay, an internal triggering event is a trigger event that is fully self contained, right? It is something that is it's happening to someone. It's within themselves, going on in their life, fully self contained. This means they can be difficult to identify, because people aren't necessarily, you know, wearing T shirts, talking about their internal triggering events. But they're really, really, really powerful. Okay, really powerful because they're impacting the most important aspect of everyone's life, themselves. All right, the next type is external. These are outside forces coming in and impacting them. External ones are a little bit easier to enter, to identify than internal, because you can see not just what they're going through, but it's easy to know that, okay, this is just happening, right? This is this just absolutely it's happening. And I'm gonna give you some examples in just a little bit. And then seasonal. Seasonal are the most predictable of all, you know, in general, we kind of know when New Year's is every year, it's approximately January 1. I'm sure you knew that as well, right? So seasonal, very easy to identify, doesn't always directly impact the you know, decision making, but it does it a lot more than than you might think it does. So let's talk about some internal triggering events, and I want to give you some questions that I want you to ask yourself and be jotting down some notes as you're going through these. In fact, this might be a great opportunity to pause this video to gather your team together and brainstorm these collectively as a team. I love using little post it notes for this. Get out post it notes. Write one down, stick it aside. Okay, so as we're doing this, if you want to pause this video to really brainstorm in each question, do it. So let's think about types of triggering events, starting with internal so what takes a lot of time costs too much or requires too much effort. All right, what takes a lot of time costs too much or requires too much effort. With regard to to your business, right? We want to think in terms of your prospect, your customers. So for digital market or lab, right, training new employees takes a lot of time. It, depending on how much you're gonna, you know, depending if you're gonna send them outside to get trained, it can be very costly, but it definitely requires an enormous amount of effort, right? So what's going on? What are your prospects currently dealing with? And you don't even have to filter it initially, with the problems that your product or service solves. We'll get there eventually. But you know, what are they currently going through that takes a lot of time, costs too much, requires too much effort, all right? Time, money and effort. Question number two, what do they dream about? What are their secret desires, right? What do they dream about? What are their secret desires? What are those things that internally, you know, when they when they lay down like, ah, you know, I wish, I wish I could have this. You know, what annoys, frustrates and or disappoints them, what keeps them up at night so kind of opposite to their secret desires and their dreams? What's the opposite of that? One of the things that they have to deal with every single day they're like, this is bothering the heck out of me, right? This is driving me insane. I know, for example, with digital marketer HQ and with our marketing executives, they really don't like having to work with under performers. What they want to do is gather their entire team into a room. They want to have a whiteboard up. They want to they want to kind of strategize and brainstorm different marketing plans, and they want to send everybody out to go and execute on that. They want to be strategists. And they want to work with their higher performers. They really don't want to have to deal with, ALL RIGHT? Jimmy, you know, seems like you're still kind of having an issue with this, you know, blogging stuff. Let me help you out. Let's do they don't want to do that, right? They want to outsource that to someone else. So that's what we say. Like, Hey, let us train your people so you don't have to. Let us develop your people so you don't have to, okay, so what annoys, frustrates andor disappoints them. What disappointing is a big word, like, what are the things that they constantly find disappointing? And what do they fear? Right? We got their dreams. What are their nightmares? Number four, what common mistakes do they frequently make? What common mistakes do they frequently make for our executives, it's mishires Bad hires. So one of the ways we've been able to do position digital market or HQ is say, before you hire these people, have them go through one of these trainings. It'll, you know, avoid you having to make it a miss hire. You'll have an objective thing that you can that you can go through. Now, we didn't come up with that idea, right? That. Was one of our customers. It just turns out they told us, yeah, let me tell you a cool way that I'm using HQ. I'm actually putting people through it because it was just just annoying me to no end. I kept screwing up and making bad hires, and I didn't want to do that anymore, so I figured, heck, screw having them do it on once they're hired. I'm having them do it on the front end. I never thought about that positioning for our particular product, but now that someone told us that we're beginning to put on the front end advertise that it can be used that way, our sales team, when they're talking to people, are using it that way as well. And it's resonant, because that's a common mistake number five, what birthdays and other maturation changes do they most fear this is very internal, right? Very internal. Not as much a B to B type thing. But when you think about, you know, B to C, any type of, you know, health, weight loss, 50 is a magical age, right? It is 50 is like New Year's Day for human beings, right? There's a big reset. You Get It At 40, you get it at 30, you don't get it at 20, but you get it maybe, you know, I would guess that you get it at 60. So these are big turning points in people's lives that are relatively predictable. When somebody kind of crosses over into that new decade. That's a maturation change that they might fear a little bit and want to respond to, and then what birthdays and other maturation changes do they most welcome one of things they're really, really excited about, right? So, you know, when somebody turns 18, you know when they turn maybe even when they turn 30, right? You know, doing things around, you're a real adult now, you know you're 30, like, let's do this. So thinking about this, these are very internal, right? The world is not doing this to them. They're aging all on their own. And in many cases, there's no reason you know age is just a number. You're only one day older when you go from 29 to 30 or 49 to 50. But mentally, internally, it makes a big deal. So review this list and jot out as many ideas as you can on post it notes again. Pause this video if you need to do it. But once you've got all of them that you can we can move on to the next type of triggering event, which is external. All right, so when we think of external here are some questions that we can ask. What tasks are they likely to be assigned by an authority figure? Remember external things happening to them? They're being assigned a task. They're being assigned a task, go build an internal digital marketing team. Director of Marketing, we're currently outsourcing too much to agencies, bring it in. They got assigned a task. What are those tasks that could be happening? What are some key systems in their life that are likely to fail? Right? Think about your market. What are the tools that they use every single day. What are the services that they subscribe to that could potentially fail? Right? Those are all things that you can target, both in advertising and messaging. We'll get to targeting when we get into the last module, when Molly talks about targeting, but for now, it's just good to keep those in mind. What major events, meetings are they likely to attend? What major events and meetings are they likely attend? If you do trade shows, right? If you exhibit at trade shows, if you sponsor major events, then what you are doing is you are participating and benefiting from an external triggering event. So write those down, right? That's a trigger event. Everybody's coming together in this one place. Really big deal, right? I know, I know, Canton Fair in China, really large trade show. We're able to get a lot of things done around that event because it's gathering so many different manufacturers as well as importers. So that's a biggie that we do. What difficulties, challenges and roadblocks are they likely to face right in their business. This really is key. If you go back to question number two, what are some key systems that are likely to fail? It's kind of that same question asked slightly differently, what difficulties, challenges and roadblocks are they likely to face, and what features or lack of features do they regularly complain about? All right, what features or lack of features do they regularly complain about? I'm not going to name any names, but there, you know, there's software out there that exists and is very successful purely because a big, giant, 800 pound gorilla had some key issues that they never wanted to resolve. So some other companies did it for them with a different solution. Right? You could be that company, or you could solve the problem with your own software. If you're the one that people are complaining about and complaining about, and use it as a as a new marketing Avenue, what's something they're forced to interact with that's difficult to understand or hard to get done? What's something they are forced to interact with that's difficult to understand or hard to get done? Even if your product or service does not resolve this problem yet itself, right? Maybe it'll, you know, jog some ideas. We could add that, or maybe, if we just did an article about that, you know, that would be something that could attract our audience and pull them in. So don't necessarily limit it to just the stuff that your product or service solves, not yet what's something they're forced to interact with that's hard to understand. End, that's, you know, hard to get done. And then finally, what negative social consequences or changes in status do they fear the most? And conversely, what positive social changes are fear and status. I know for our people. I know no no for our people, because we hear it, especially the at the executive level. They are terrified of getting fired. Directors of marketing, marketing managers, VPs of marketing. They are terrified of getting fired. They are terrified that if they can't figure out this digital stuff, that they're going to get found out, that the boss is going to kick them out, and that they're going to bring in some new young whipper snapper to replace them. That is their biggest fear, that is a, you know, getting let go, getting getting laid off, especially if you're getting replaced by a younger, better version of yourself, supposedly, is a gigantic hit to status. All right, so what is it for you? What are the status issues that they might that they might be resolving? These are all external. Now, let's have fun. Let's talk seasonal. Let's talk holiday. So I've included a holiday planner so you can get a sense of where things are going. Now, obviously, if you're down in southern hemisphere, if you're our friends in Australia, you're going to kind of need to flip this just a little bit with some things, because when it's freezing here in the States, it's quite warm and nice where you are. But I'm guessing you could figure that out, but it gives you a sense of, you know what? What's going on? You know? What are some of the themes that persist? I want to really break this down and give you some other examples. Let's look at January, right? What are some common holidays in January? Obviously, health, fitness, diet, but also organization resolution. January is a magical month. December. Similarly, that this is when people just are open to change. January. It is a portal from one year to a new year, and anytime humans pass through a portal, they are very much open to change. So that's why I don't care if you have nothing to do with health, fitness, diet, right? Still, in the month of January, that is an opportunity for you to present a new offer, because that is when humans are most open to change. January, resolution season, lots of resolutions. Make sure that you're active with your marketing. Here with a message that is about change. February, Valentine's Day, Presidents Day, Black History Month, heart health, okay? These are all themes around that particular month. Most of these are not holidays, per se. They may not even be a holiday. You know, where you are, President's Day is obviously, you know, specific to, you know, to the US, but a good theme, love. You know that that's why heart health is was added. You know, in that particular month, March. Easter often falls in March, sometimes April, but you have Easter, St Patrick's Day, March Madness, which is the college tournament here in the States. Women's History Month, sleep awareness, I didn't know that. National Nutrition Month. The funny thing about this, and that's why you should google certain holidays, the holidays don't have to be known by your audience to still be meaningful. If you simply tell them, if you're a mattress store, and you say, hey, March is sleep Awareness Month. Oh, it is. Yeah, that's why it's a great time to buy a mattress. Okay, right? I mean, one has nothing to do with another, but it's, it gives you an opportunity. It's something to highlight. Let's look at April Passover, April Fool's Day, right? There's some fun things that you could do in terms of playing a joke, but still having, you know, a sale or some stuff around that Earth Day, Arbor Day, Administrative Professionals day, if you're a B to B type offering, may national Teachers Day, Cinco de Mayo, Mother's Day, Kentucky Derby, armed forces. It's a big one, because it's, we're getting into summer, spring, spring or summer cleaning, I guess it's, you know, spring cleaning extended. This is another time when you'll have people just purge and do another spring clean in the summer vacation planning and swimsuit season, all right? So this is when people are starting to think, Freedom vacation, great time to sell books and stuff like that, right? That's, that's when they want to do more passive consumption. And then June, National Safety Month, Father's Day graduation. I thought that was funny. National Donut Day, who knew that was a thing? And national best friends day, again, the holiday doesn't have to be known by your market to still be meaningful. Let's keep going. July, Canada Day, Fourth of July. Parents Day, ice cream day, Hot Dog Day, tequila day, people are having a lot of fun in July, national parks month, national picnic month, right? Clearly, this is picnic season. This is family. Go with the theme, right? What is the theme of this August? Back to school, football, National Dog Day, beer day, yay sister day, who knew right? September, Labor Day, Grandparents Day, National cheeseburger day, you also get the beginning of fall, right fall now people prior to that, they're very open. They're out now. They're beginning to close in. They're beginning to turn in and get back to family. October. Coffee Day, Yom Kippur, World Food Day. Okay, cats, you know, dogs, I guess got August. Cats get October. Halloween is one of, is the one of the largest, I think it is the largest celebrated holiday for adults. Crazy, Halloween, big, big, big deal. November, yeah, Thanksgiving, Black Friday. Black Friday is now the entire month of November. All over the world, it is crazy. You get small business Daylight Savings elections if it's that time of year, and then December, holiday promotions. You know you could do your last chance tax deductions into the year, special offer and really resolutions begin in December. If you would do your January offer starting in December can be very, very effective. So these are just kind of here to jog your memory. Get some ideas going. It's worth doing some searches, though, to see if there's more that are relevant to your market, because these are very, very, very predictable. So again, now it's your turn. Get your team together, get out all the post it notes, and brainstorm as many ideas as you can and fill up that predictable sales canvas with all the ideas that you possibly can come up with. Hopefully you run out of space long before you run out of ideas. And if that happens, that's okay, because in just a little bit, I'm going to show you how to actually filter them and create a hierarchy on which ones you should start with. But for now, forget the filtering. There are no bad ideas. Just write down as many of them as you can, involving as many people on your team as possible. Once you have all the ideas, once this thing is so filled up that you can't even see the paper anymore, then you're done and you're ready to move on to the next video. You.
