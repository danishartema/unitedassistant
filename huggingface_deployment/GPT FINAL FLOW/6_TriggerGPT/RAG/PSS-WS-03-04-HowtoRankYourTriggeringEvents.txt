All right. So now we are back, and it is time to actually rank your triggering events that you brainstormed in the previous video. So hopefully you took my advice and you just filled up this section of your predictable sales canvas, and hopefully you can't even see the freaking paper, hopefully using different colors, and so it's just a rainbow of excitement and enthusiasm and craziness so crazy and exciting that we gotta narrow it down. We gotta filter it down because, heck, you can't target everything. You can't message anything. We gotta figure out, you know, what are we gonna start with? Right? And usually what we're asking ourselves and recognizing is that some triggering events are obviously going to be more predictable than others, and similarly, some triggering events are gonna have more impact than others. So this idea of impact versus predictability, right? Clearly, if something is high high impact and highly predictable, right, that's the sweet spot, high impact, high predictability. That's a triggering event that we maybe want to begin to build some predictable selling systems around if it's high impact, but not very predictable, you know, that could be great, but it might require a little more manual labor. So depending on the strategy, maybe that's, you know, maybe that's a good fit. Maybe not. And if it's ultra predictable but no real impact, then what's the point? You're kind of answering a question that nobody's asking. So how do we kind of balance this out? We're going to use a predictability impact grid. We use something similar, if you recall, when we were identifying, you know, ideal, ideal sales conversations. We're doing the same thing here. So we want to take the team and plot it on this spectrum. The more predictable it is, the higher up it goes, the greater the impact, the further over that it goes. So if we're thinking about something like a job promotion, for example, right? A job promotion, this is something that's massive impact. If somebody gets promoted to a chief, you know, marketing officer, or a VP of marketing, or director of marketing, there's a good chance that they're gonna want Digital Marketer, HQ, right there. They're right there, in that sweet spot. They've got the team. They the timing is right, they've got the budget. This is high impact, but it's not very predictable, because I'm not friends with every single CEO on planet Earth. They're not sending me emails saying, Hey, Ryan, FY, about to promote. You know, Fred, might want to send an email a couple days, right? I wish that were happening, but it just isn't so. Job promotion, low, high on the impact, low on predictability. Starting an agency. Funny enough, this is actually relatively predictable. If somebody starts an agency, there's certain things that they tend to do. We're able to target them. They start following different groups on Facebook. We can find them if they begin to join these things. It's easier than one might think, and it's actually pretty impactful. If somebody's starting an agency, they've got a team that they're going to need to train and onboard in all things digital marketing. So that's a decently that's pretty good one end of the year, end of the year, highly predictable. We know exactly when every year is going to end, especially now that that whole Mayan Calendar thing is done, we're pretty much set on this one, and it's actually pretty high impact, right? It's pretty high when it comes to impact, because that's when people are making changes. They're making decisions, that's when they have budget that they need to spend, right? So end of the year, pretty good. Attending Traffic and Conversion Summit. That's really a sweet spot, right? We know exactly when it's going to be. Heck, it's our event. We scheduled it so predictability really high and insanely high from an impact perspective, if somebody attends trafficking Conversion Summit, there's a really great chance that they should invest in digital market or HQ, either for themselves or their company or their clients. What about inbound? Okay, inbound Summit. This is hubspots Big Conference, again, very predictable, not quite as predictable as ours from year to year like we know exactly when ours is going to be inbound. We know when it's going to be when they announce it so very predictable and decent on the impact, right? Not as impactful as attending our event, but still pretty solid. How about St Patrick's Day? Highly predictable. I know exactly when St Patrick's Day is gonna be, but you know what? Nobody freaking cares. Hey, it's St Patrick's Day. You should change. You should train your digital marketing team using digital marketer HQ, I'm sure we'd have had we do this exercise in our office. We're gonna have some chuckle head in our office. Say St Patrick's Day predict. So that's why I put that up there, and also running a marathon. Now we're talking about something that is neither predictable nor impactful, right? I don't know if we've ever had a marketing executive say, you know, because I just ran that marathon Digital Marketer. HQ, that's for me, never happened. So there's an example of something that is neither predictable nor impactful. Now we want to do is overlay the grid. Remember the green area in the upper right hand corner. That's a sweet spot, really. Anything even touching that area, we know we want to invest we know that we want to take a close look at it. Anything in the red, you can pretty much immediately disqualify it. Anything in the red area, neither predictable nor impactful. And now we're looking at the yellow. So much of it depends on your strategy, right? So much of it depends on your strategy. So maybe. Look at it and you go, St Patrick's Day. Yeah, highly predictable, but now that's stupid. What about everything else? End of the year? Inbound, yep, we can make this investment starting an agency. We could do that job promotion really low on the predictable on the predictability scale, but it's so impactful that maybe it makes sense to bring in a sales development representative that all they do is just creepily stalk people on on LinkedIn, and every single time they get a promotion, you know, we're looking at it, we're beginning to engage with them, right? So if it's predictable, if it's impactful enough, even if it's low on the predictability scale, not going to do it typically, if it's, you know, if it's kind of too far beyond this point, from an impact perspective, it may not be worth investing in like so, for example, sponsoring other events kind of on the edge in this case, though, that's something that we do. It's impactful enough and it's predictable enough that we're going to go ahead and make that investment. So we look at all these what we're gonna do next is plot them in order go back to this canvas. We don't have to throw away all the other ideas. They're fine. We may come back to them later, but get them plotted in order know what you're gonna focus on, and know the you know, two, three, maybe four at most, triggering events that you're gonna focus on. In creating your predictable sales canvas and getting a whole lot more ideal sales conversations. Once you've done this, we can move on to the next video and get into your action items. You.
