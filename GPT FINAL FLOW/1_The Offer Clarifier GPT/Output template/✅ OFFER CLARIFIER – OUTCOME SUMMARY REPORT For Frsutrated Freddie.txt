✅ OFFER CLARIFIER – OUTCOME SUMMARY REPORT
💼 Offer Name
 Eureka Ideation Machine (powered by Eddie)
🌟 Core Transformation / Outcome
 The Eureka Ideation Machine helps you get unstuck by giving you fresh, ready-to-use marketing ideas to grow your business. It’s like having a team of A-list marketers in a think tank, ready to brainstorm with you and deliver 2–3 complete campaign plans — showing you what to say, how to say it, and where to say it — so you can attract more customers without the guesswork.
📦 Key Features
Multiple marketing bots that help brainstorm and build campaigns based on your perfect customer.

A guided process that asks the right questions and tailors strategies using your input.

Memory-enabled assistant that remembers your ideas and updates plans as your thoughts evolve.

All ideas and documents are stored in a dedicated “project vault” so you can return anytime.

Simple and intuitive — anyone can use it without needing marketing experience.

🚚 Delivery Method
 Starts with three live mini-classes (also recorded for on-demand access) on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, helping users define their offer, customer, and journey. After that, users access Eddie to develop campaigns and strategies based on their work.
🧩 Format
 Hybrid program combining a course, guided software, and membership platform. Includes a basic and pro version, with coaching and advanced tools for deeper support.
💰 Price & Payment
Basic – $39/month (annual) or $49/month (monthly) – 1 saved project

Solopreneur – $97/month – 3 saved projects

Pro – $197/month (10 projects) or $297/month (unlimited)

Premier – $497/month – includes AI Voice Agent trained by Eddie + Database Reactivation campaign

🧠 Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
 Everything you create with Eddie is saved and organized in your personal idea vault. You’re not just getting one-off ideas — you’re building a growing think tank of well-designed, strategic marketing campaigns that flow step-by-step from ideation to execution.
🎯 Target Audience
 Anyone with a product or service to sell who needs fresh marketing ideas — from business owners and marketers to salespeople and service providers. Ideal for those who feel stuck, want proven strategies, and don’t want to hire expensive agencies.
🔥 Problems Solved
Lack of new marketing ideas to grow the business.

Expensive, biased marketing advice from agencies.

No clear plan to hand off to a marketing team.
