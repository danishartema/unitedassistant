EDDIE’s Dead Lead Revival Kit
Turn Old Leads into Booked Calls in Under an Hour



💡 Why This Works
Most “dead” leads are just dormant — they showed interest once, and that’s more than half the battle.
This kit gives you 3 simple, human-sounding messages you can send by email, text, or voicemail. No pressure. No funnel. Just a natural re-engagement.

✉️ Email Script (Use if it’s been 2+ weeks)
Subject Options:
“Are you still looking for [SERVICE] help?”

“Quick follow-up — still interested?”

Message:
Hey [First Name],

We connected a while back about [SERVICE]. Just wanted to check if you’re still looking for help in that area?

We’ve opened up a few new spots this week. Let me know if you’d like to grab one — no pressure either way.

Best,  
[Your Name]




📲 SMS Script (For quick check-ins)
Hey [First Name], it’s [Your Name] — we talked a while ago about [SERVICE]. Just opened a few spots. Still interested? Want me to hold one for you?


🔁 Voicemail Script (Or use as voice memo/email audio)
Hey [First Name], this is [Your Name] — just checking in on our last convo about [SERVICE]. Got a few quick-start slots open this week. Let me know if you want one. Talk soon!


📈 How to Use This:
Export your old leads from your CRM or inbox.

Pick 25–100 who showed interest in the past 1–12 months.

Send them one of the scripts above.

Follow up with a reminder 48 hours later.


⚡ Pro Tip from EDDIE
Don’t try to close them. Just reopen the conversation. You’re re-engaging, not selling. Be real. Be brief. Be helpful.
