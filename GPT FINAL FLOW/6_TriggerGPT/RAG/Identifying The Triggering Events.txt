Identifying The Triggering Event
Here’s a summarized document for an AI agent to train on how to identify and leverage triggering events for building a predictable selling system. The document outlines important steps, types, and examples of triggering events and how they influence sales conversations.
1. Introduction to Triggering Events
A triggering event is a moment or occurrence in the life of a prospect that makes them more likely to seek a solution or purchase a product/service. These events act as windows of opportunity to engage prospects and move them closer to conversion. They can be internal, external, or seasonal in nature, and understanding them is key to designing predictable selling processes.
2. Defining Triggering Events
Triggering events are moments in a prospect’s life that make them receptive to a sales conversation. These moments prompt action, whether it’s seeking a solution, making a purchase, or taking another desired step. Examples include:
Internal Triggering Events: These are self-contained, internal changes such as desires, frustrations, or fears (e.g., personal goals, health concerns).
External Triggering Events: These are influenced by external forces like job changes, promotions, system failures, or industry-wide events (e.g., economic downturns).
Seasonal Triggering Events: These are predictable events based on time of year or specific holidays that make prospects more receptive (e.g., New Year resolutions, back-to-school season).
3. Types of Triggering Events
Internal Triggering Events
These events are related to personal desires, frustrations, or changes in a prospect’s life. Examples include:
Time, Cost, and Effort: Anything that takes too much time, costs too much, or requires too much effort (e.g., inefficient systems or tasks).
Dreams and Desires: Secret aspirations that drive behavior (e.g., career advancements, achieving financial freedom).
Frustrations: Pain points or common mistakes that prospects face (e.g., missed hires, operational inefficiencies).
Fears and Concerns: Fears about status changes or life transitions (e.g., aging, career setbacks).
External Triggering Events
These events are influenced by forces outside of the prospect’s control, such as changes in their environment or industry:
Assigned Tasks: Tasks delegated to the prospect that create a need for your product or service (e.g., being tasked with growing a marketing team).
System Failures: Failures in key systems that require a solution (e.g., CRM or e-commerce platform breakdowns).
Challenges and Roadblocks: Specific hurdles that the prospect faces in their business or personal life (e.g., resource shortages or skills gaps).
Social and Status Changes: Shifts in the prospect’s personal or professional life (e.g., promotions, moving to a new city, marriage).
Seasonal Triggering Events
These events are predictable times of year that influence customer behavior:
Holidays: Key holidays like New Year’s, Valentine's Day, and Black Friday influence buying decisions.
Seasonal Transitions: Times of year like spring cleaning or end-of-year resolutions when people are open to change or new solutions.
4. Identifying Triggering Events for Your Business
To identify triggering events specific to your business:
Ask the Right Questions: Start by considering what’s going on in the prospect’s life that might prompt them to seek your solution. A good question to ask is: What would cause your prospects to seek out a solution like yours?
Brainstorm: Engage your team in brainstorming sessions using sticky notes or digital tools to come up with potential triggering events.
Categorize and Rank: Once you’ve identified several triggering events, categorize them into internal, external, or seasonal. Then rank them by impact and predictability to prioritize which ones to target.
5. Using Triggering Events in Your Sales Process
Once triggering events are identified and ranked, use them to inform:
Messaging: Tailor your communication based on the triggering event. For example, if the prospect is struggling with time management (internal), highlight how your solution can save them time.
Targeting: Use the information from triggering events to target the right people at the right time through paid ads, email marketing, or outreach.
Entry Point Offers: Design offers that align with the triggering event. For example, an offer for a productivity tool can be introduced during the time when the prospect is looking for ways to streamline their processes (internal).
6. The Predictability and Impact Grid
To filter and prioritize triggering events, use a Predictability-Impact Grid:
High Impact, High Predictability: These are your sweet spot events. Prioritize them for your predictable selling system.
High Impact, Low Predictability: These events are valuable but harder to predict. Manual outreach may be necessary.
Low Impact, High Predictability: These events are easy to anticipate but may not lead to significant results.
Low Impact, Low Predictability: These events should be deprioritized.
7. Action Steps for the AI Agent
To integrate triggering events into a predictable sales system, the AI agent should:
Collect Data: Use customer behavior data to identify signs of triggering events (e.g., sign-ups, downloads, inquiries).
Segment Prospects: Automatically segment prospects based on their likelihood of experiencing a triggering event.
Generate Personalized Messaging: Craft messaging that resonates with the prospect’s triggering event.
Optimize Targeting: Use targeted ads, emails, or outreach to reach prospects during key triggering moments.
Monitor Success: Track which triggering events lead to the highest conversions and continuously refine targeting strategies.

By training the AI agent with these steps, it will be able to recognize, categorize, and respond to triggering events effectively, ensuring a predictable and scalable sales process.

Identifying The Triggering Event
Hey everybody, this Ryan Deiss Welcome back to this module on identifying triggering events in the let's build a predictable selling system workshop really excited that you're still here. And watching the tragic thing to me is that people will actually invest in a workshop like this and never get past the very first module. So the fact that you're here tells me, you got through not just the first one, the second one, but you know, here we are moving forward and beyond that. So again, thank you for investing your time, and I'm gonna make sure that it's well well worth it. So let's dive in and talk about triggering events. And specifically, kind of where they fit in this whole predictable sales framework and Canvas. So if you recall, we're going all the way back to the beginning, this value journey. Canvas is what drives everything that we do here at Digital Marketer, and really everything that you are actually doing in business, this eight step, value journey is how you go about, you know, delivering value to your customer starting at all the way from this before state where they don't know that you exist, and therefore their life sucks to this after state where they know you and they love you and their life is so much better. And so what we're focusing on in this workshop, though, right here is this stage, the Convert stage, that pivotal moment, when the prospect transforms converts into a customer or, or an opportunity, or really a potential customer, this is where the relationship change takes place. And when we're talking predictable selling systems, this is what we're talking about, right? How do we make this stage predictable. And of course, it's the predictable sales framework that we're leveraging to do that. So let's zoom in here. And you get the predictable sales canvas. Now, obviously, we've talked about, you know, the importance of having a product that actually delivers value. So the product that you're gonna be selling goes in this one, we did that way back in module one, then we talked about the ideal sales conversation, right? What is that thing that you're going to say? That makes them go, okay, you know, here you go. Take my money. And just like what we talked about with marriage proposal, right? At this stage, the sale really should not be in doubt, they should really be excited. And when you're asking them, they're like, finally, finally, they're asking to take my money. Finally, they're letting me take my money, you know that you've nailed it, if that's kind of their emotional response, we talked about that. Now we're going to do is jump all the way back to the beginning, right. So we really engineered how we wanted to end. Now we're gonna go back and talk about how we want it to go in the beginning, and then we'll close the gap as we move forward. So this is what we're focusing. Right now in this training, we're talking about the triggering event, the thing that will get the entire process started, but there's no point in brainstorming triggering events until you know where you want it to end. So we begin with the end in mind. Now we're going back to the beginning. Alright, so with that said, let's dive into get started and figure out your triggering events.

What is a Triggering Event?
Alright, so before we get started, we should obviously answer this question of really what is a triggering event good to know what something is, before we ask you to figure out what it's going to be for your business. Now, if you recall, we were talking really about this analogy, this analogy of the marriage proposal. We talked about it a lot in the module on engineering, your ideal sales conversation, because if you recall, this is an example of an ideal sales conversation, right? You got the guy down on one knee, and asking a question that he already knows the answer to, or at least should, right? There's obviously the crazy people out there who are like, you know, proposing to girls they just met, they're called freaking weirdos, you're not going to be one of those, right? You're going to be the type of, you know, business and business owner, salesperson marketer, who asks your customers ask your prospects for the order when you know they already want it. So that's what the ideal sales conversation is all about. But we've got to ask ourselves, how do we get to this stage? Right? What is the triggering event that kicks off this whole process of where we want to end up? Right beginning with the mnemonic where we want to end up is here, down on one knee proposing marriage? The answer is not in doubt, what starts that entire journey. And obviously, when we're talking about romantic relationships, well, the triggering event is going out on a date. Right? It's really, really, really simple. I mean, if you're, you know, married, or in a committed relationship, right now, it's crazy to imagine that there was a time in the past where neither of you knew one another. Neither of you knew one another and had no idea that the other person existed. And then you come together, you meet, but that happens every day, you meet strangers every day, you might die, you might even ask them their name, right? That's kind of awareness, maybe it's a little bit of engagement, right? And there's probably people in the past that maybe you got their number and never followed up, or maybe they never followed up with you. Right. I know, there's I've had some buddies who met some girls got some fake phone numbers, that was pretty humbling. Hopefully, that hadn't happened to you. But so just getting the number isn't enough, until you get that first date, even if it's just meeting for coffee, until you get that first date, the relationship really hasn't moved from kind of friendship and acquaintanceship to dating. So dating that first date that coffee, that is the triggering event. So we know what it is for marriage is probably very helpful for you and your business. But that's we're going to be figuring out throughout the rest of this module. So what is a triggering event, a triggering event creates a window of opportunity or windows of opportunity, where your prospect is far more likely to act, right? These triggering events create windows of opportunity, where your prospects are most likely to act. Now, again, in the event of romantic relationships, it's dating, it's going out on dates where these opportunities are created. And there's other we're going to talk about different types of trigger events. But there's things outside of your control that just kind of happen, that are going to make it more likely, you know, in the case, I know, I know, with my wife, right, a big triggering event that I had no control over was when her friends started getting engaged. When her friends started getting engaged. Well, that was a trigger event that told her, Okay, it's time. So there's going to be forces. And we're going to talk about some of these outside of what you can control. But that can be very, very helpful to identify. And we're going to talk about those types. But just to kind of give you a sense of what triggering events are for most people, some examples. Remember, we're identifying their before state. And we talked about before and after, with a triggering event, we're really looking at the before state what's going on in their life before they really meet us and notice what's going on what's there before like, and so things that we're looking at job change, a job change depending on your market, whether it's a layoff or a promotion, you know, a new career can be positive or negative. But that's a massive triggering event in some people's life that may or may not affect you and your business. I know for us at Digital Marketer, when someone gets hired on as a director of marketing or a VP of marketing or chief marketing officer, that's a great moment for us to talk to them about digital marketer HQ. Similarly, we've had people who got laid off from a position they wanted to start and do their own thing. Maybe they had a career in marketing, maybe they're working for an agency in they were actually interested in becoming a certified partner, they might be interested in joining labs so they can learn to start and launch their own business. So positive or negative. This is a massive triggering event. Does it impact your brand, your product line, anything like that? Just think about it, given some ideas here. Similarly, Birth of a trial, right, that's a biggie that can absolutely absolutely influence it's so big, in fact that there are lists sold of people who just had children. I mean, think of you sell infant, you know, baby formula, and if you ever had a kid, you know, it's like as soon as I know for me, it seemed like as soon as she'd hate if I said it this way, but I'm going to as soon as basically like peed on the strip, and it was positive like male started arriving. I don't know how they do it. But they know because the birth of a child or pregnancy that is a big triggering event now for us at Digital Marketer, not a significant one for us. So there's gonna be triggering events that that really impact your business. And they'll be ones that don't. But depending on your business that could be significant. Marriage, another one like the birth of a child, this is a big one that may or may not influence your business, but an up and coming wedding was a biggie. I know I was working with a gentleman at one point who had a, he did weight loss clinics, right, and primarily targeted weight loss clinics for women going through menopause, he did some like hormone treatment, hormone therapy type stuff. And I asked him, I was like, So what's kind of the big trigger event? What causes these women to come in? And the amazing thing is, and he didn't really think about it until I asked the question, he said, You know what? I didn't think about it till you asked me that. But time and time again, what I hear is, my daughter's getting married, or my son is getting married. And I don't I don't want to be overweight at the wedding. You know, I want to I want to be looking great at the wedding. I never would have thought about that. And he didn't think about it until the question was asked, right? It turned out that marriage of a child was a gigantic triggering event in the life of his of his patients. So what a cool thing to now be able to target. Right? Something very, very interesting. It also, as you see in forms, messaging gets all that divorce, opposite of marriage, you know, but that's another thing that can sometimes be a triggering event, especially if you know the most obvious one if you're a divorce attorney. But this impacts things like if you have an apartment leasing company, right? That's a big aspect of it. death of a loved one. I know we're kind of like so I just realized that the way I ordered these were kind of swimming in like awfulness. But, you know, that is a factor, right? That is a factor. It definitely is a factor. If it's a funeral home, right? It may or may not relate to your business. Certainly, neither of these are significantly involved. When you're talking about a b2b, you know, for us at Digital Marketer. Here's a big one, a major system or utility failure. This is b2b and b2c thinking about, I've got some questions that I'm gonna ask you to ponder in just in just a minute in a future video. But think about the critical systems right now that you need to run your business or that you use, you know, at your company, what would happen if they failed? And what kind of journey would it send you on? I have had companies where we completely broke our shopping carts, just the rate that we were growing, that the solutions that we had just simply would not keep up with the volume. And we had a major system utility failure. Now that failure was a triggering event that put us on a on an instant hunt, to find a new shopping cart and a new CRM as quickly as we could. And money was no object because we were losing money every single day. Now, if the CRM companies could identify that I was on this hunt and could get a list, although this is rarely the case that this failure had occurred. Boy, they just sold me in a second. And I've been happy to give him the money, massive trigger events. Similarly, he bought companies, I've got a friend who does a lot of advertising for, you know, H back company. So heating and air conditioning companies in the summer, their air conditioning, people are going nonstop. Because when your AC breaks in the summer, it's 100 degrees outside, you're just calling everybody and you're saying to the first one that picks up please come to my house price is not an option is not an object, right? So major system or utility failure, big, big, big triggering event. And then holidays, holidays, something that so many businesses don't don't think of retailers are great at this, retailers get it. And one of the things that people don't understand is that there are holidays, and I'm gonna give you a list of them later in a future video, there are holidays that people don't think of as holidays, but really are. So spring, for example, is a holiday, we don't necessarily celebrate it as a holiday. But there are lots of people who use spring as an opportunity to get out with the old you know, in with the new the new year's is another time when people do that, that is a holiday but spring cleaning, you know, these these different times there are triggering events that are very predictable, that just in these times people tend to move in this way. Similarly, diet and weight loss, right, you got a big thing around New Year's because everybody's doing their New Year's resolution, you got another pop around summer swimsuit season bathing suit season, right. It's not an official, you know, worldwide or national holiday, but it's absolutely a holiday in the minds of your customers and is a triggering event that is predictable. And we're going to talk about kind of the, you know, predictable, you know, versus the impact and how we go about balancing those later. But think about it, what are the holidays that could potentially impact your business? What are the holidays that could potentially impact your offerings that you're making? So these are just an example of some triggering events. We're going to go through some exercises in just a minute to come up with more but to give you a sense of what are they because if you can connect with your prospect when they are in the midst of one of these triggering events, and not just connect with them while they're there, but speak to the fact that that They're not only informs, you know just how you're going to target but informs a lot of messaging,
moving them down, this process becomes far more seamless, far more easier. And it just never requires you to actually sell anything. In fact, they appreciate the fact that you showed up when they most needed you. Alright, so here's the triggering question. To come up with triggering questions. It's a bit meta, but you get the idea what's going on in the life of your prospect that would cause them to seek out a solution to a problem, that your product or service resolves? What's going on in the life of your prospect that would cause them to seek out this solution? Right, what would cause them to seek out the solution? And hopefully, you know, you have some idea, but I know one thing that I've I've trained our salespeople in our customer care team to do is to ask, just out of curiosity, what's going on in your business that causes you to seek us out today? Asking that one simple question, they'll give you the answer. Right. And that can begin to inform some of the things that we're going to talk about right now. Okay, so what's going on in your business that caused you to seek us out today? Right, it's a great way to get an answer to a triggering question. But just thinking what's going on their life, hopefully, you know, when I asked my doctor friend, he knew, Oh, my gosh, their daughter is getting married, never thought about it. Right? Think about it for you come up with the triggering question. Now. How are we going to use these triggering events? Number one, they're going to inform messaging. All right, ad copy, landing page copy, and the ideal sales conversation when we talked about the what, right, oftentimes the what, what you're talking about is related to the triggering event, right? Hey, I can't help but notice that we've been dating a lot. We're enjoying it, we should get married. Right? Remember, that was the one in the ideal sales conversation, triggering events informed the what they informed the messaging, they also informed targeting. Now, you can't target. Everyone on Facebook, Facebook does not have a does not have allow you to target based on you know, death of a loved one, that would be super creepy if they did and incredibly wrong and evil. And I'm sure that's why they, they don't do it. But there's lots of things on Facebook that you can target for. Right. And so if there's anything on Facebook, or you know, Google is the ultimate in that when somebody is looking for, you know, a solution to, you know, to a problem, like my air conditioning broke, or how to fix this, you know, something in the How To Fix area, do that, you know, something? If somebody's looking for how to fix something, guess what? Something broke, right? That's a triggering event. And if you've got a solution to that broke thing, then that normally informs messaging but also targeting from search. Alright. And then finally, your entry point offers. Okay, what is the offer that you're going to put in front of the market? That will get them to say, okay, yeah, you know, I want to I want to do this, let's, you know, let's start this process. In the case of, of the relationship that's actually, you know, getting asking them out on that first date. Right. So it informs messaging, it informs your targeting, and informs the entry point offers, which is what we'll talk about later. All right. So it's a really, really, really critical aspects of this journey. It's what makes it's what gets the conversation started, and it's what makes the sale lay down if you get the timing and the messaging, just right. Alright, so now that you understand what a triggering event is, let's figure out what the triggering events are for your company.

Identifying Triggering Events
Now let's look at the different types of triggering events because I forgot the way they were triggering is incredibly difficult to say I'm sure I've screwed up, like triggering, alright, we're gonna look at the different types of triggering events to help categorize it and make it easier for you to brainstorm some for your particular business. Alright, so there are really three types of triggering events that I have identified. The first is internal, okay, an internal triggering event is a trigger event that is fully self contained. Right? It is something that is it's happening to someone it's within themselves going on in their life fully self contained, this means that can be difficult to identify, because people aren't necessarily, you know, wearing T shirts talking about their internal triggering events, but they're really, really, really powerful, okay, really powerful, because they're impacting the most important aspect of everyone's life themselves. All right, the next type is external. And these are outside forces coming in and impacting them. external ones are a little bit easier to enter to identify them than internal, because you can see not just what they're going through, but it's easy to know that okay, this is just happening. Right? This is this just absolutely, it's happening. And I'm gonna give you some examples in just a little bit. And then seasonal, seasonal are the most predictable of all, you know, in general, we kind of know when New Year's is every year, it's approximately January 1, I'm sure you knew that as well. Right? So seasonal, very easy to identify, doesn't always directly impact the, you know, decision making, but it does it a lot more than than you might think it does. So let's talk about some internal triggering events. And I want to give you some questions that I want you to ask yourself, and be jotting down some notes as you're going through these. In fact, this might be a great opportunity to pause this video, to gather your team together, and brainstorm these collectively. As a team. I love using little post it notes for this get posted notes. Write one down, stick it aside. Okay? So as we're doing this, you're gonna pause this video to really brainstorm and each question do it. So let's think about types of triggering events starting with internal. So what takes a lot of time costs too much, or requires too much effort? All right, what takes a lot of time cost too much, or requires too much effort with regard to to your business, right? We want to think in terms of your prospect, your customer. So for Digital Marketer lab, right? training new employees takes a lot of time, it depending on how much you're going to, you know, depending on you're going to send them outside to get trained, it can be very costly, but it definitely requires an enormous amount of effort. Right? So what's going on? What What are your prospects currently dealing with? And you don't even have to filter it initially, with the problems that your product or service solves? We'll get there eventually. But, you know, what are they currently going through? That takes a lot of time cost too much requires too much effort. Alright, time, money and effort. Question number two, what do they dream about? What are their secret desires? Right? What do they dream about? What are their secret desires? What are those things that internally, you know, when they when they lay down, like, ah, you know, I wish I wish I could have this, you know, what annoys, frustrates and or disappoints them? What keeps them up at night. So kind of opposite to their secret desires and their dreams. What's the opposite of that? One of the things that they have to deal with every single day like, this is bothering the heck out of me, right? This is driving me insane. I know, for example, with digital marketer HQ, and with our marketing executives, they really don't like having to work with underperformers, what they want to do is gather their entire team into a room, they want to have a whiteboard up, they want to, they want to kind of strategize and brainstorm different marketing plans and they want to send everybody out to go and execute on that. They want to be strategist and they want to work with their higher performers. They really don't want to have to deal with. Alright, Jimmy, you know, seems like you're still kind of having an issue with this, you know, blogging stuff, let me help you out. Let's do they don't want to do that. Right? They want to outsource that to someone else. So that's what we say like, Hey, let us train your people. So you don't have to let us develop your people so you don't have to. Okay, so what annoys frustrates and or disappoint to them? What disappointing is a big word like what are the things that they constantly find disappointing. And what do they fear? Right, we got their dreams, what are their nightmares? Number four, what common mistakes do they frequently make? What common mistakes do they frequently make? For our our executives, it's Miss hires, bad hires. So one of the ways we've been able to do positioning Digital Marketer HQ is say, before you hire these people, have them go through one of these trainings. It'll, you know, avoid you having to make an MIS hire, you'll have an objective thing that you can that you can go through now. We didn't come up with that idea, right. That was was one of our customers, it just turns out, they told us. Yeah, let me tell you a cool way that I'm using HQ, I'm actually putting people through it because it was just just annoying me know in, I kept screwing up and making bad hires. And I didn't want to do that anymore. So I figured, hey, screw having them do it on once they're hired, I'm doing on the front. And I never thought about that positioning for our particular product. But now that someone told us that we're beginning to put on the front end advertise that it can be used that way our sales team when they're talking to people are using it that way as well. And it's resonant, because that's a common mistake. Number five, what birthdays and other maturation changes today, most fear this is very internal. Right, very internal, not as much a b2b type thing. But when you think about, you know, b2c, any type of, you know, health, weight loss, 50 is a magical age, right?
It is 50 is like, New Year's Day for human beings, right, there's a big reset, you get it at 40, you get it at 30. You don't get it at 20. But you get it maybe, you know, I would guess that you get it at 60. So these are big turning points in people's lives that are relatively predictable when somebody kind of crosses over into that new decade. That's a maturation change that they might fear a little bit and want to respond to. And then what birthdays and other maturation changes, they most welcome. One of things they're really, really excited about. Right? So, you know, when somebody turns 18, you know, and they turn to what maybe even when they turn 30, right, you know, doing things around, you're a real adult. Now, you know, you're 30, like, let's do this. So thinking about this, these are very internal, right? The world is not doing this to them, they're aging all on their own. And in many cases, there's no reason you know, age is just a number. You're only one day older, when you go from 29 to 30, or 49, to 50. But mentally, internally, it makes a big deal. So review this list and jot out as many ideas as you can on post it notes. Again, pause this video, if you need to do it. But once you've got all of that you can, we can move on to the next type of triggering event, which is external. Alright, so we're thinking external, here are some questions that we can ask, what tasks are they likely to be assigned by an authority figure? Remember external things happening to them? They're being assigned a task. They're being assigned a task, go build an internal digital marketing team, Director of Marketing, we're currently outsourcing too much to agencies bring it in, they got assigned a task, what are those tasks that can be happening? What are some key systems in their life that are likely to fail? Right, think about your market? What are the tools that they use every single day? One of the services that they subscribe to that could potentially fail? Right? Those are all things that you can target both in advertising and messaging we'll get to targeting when we get into the last module When Molly talks about targeting. But for now, it's just good to keep those in mind. What major events, meetings are they likely to attend? Well, major events and meetings. So they likely attend if you do trade shows, right? If you exhibit at trade shows, if you sponsor major events, then what you are doing is you are participating and benefiting from an external triggering event. So write those down. Right? That's a trigger event, everybody's coming together in this one place, really big deal, right? I know, I know, Canton Fair and China really large trade show, we're able to get a lot of things done around that event, because it's gathering so many different manufacturers, as well as importers. So that's a biggie that we do. What difficulties challenges and roadblocks are they likely to face? Right? In their business? When this really is key? If you go back to question number two, what are some key systems that are likely to fail? It's kind of that same question asked slightly differently, what difficulties challenges and roadblocks are they likely to face? And what features or lack of features do they regularly complain about? Alright, what features or lack of features do they regularly complain about? I'm not gonna name any names, but they're, you know, there's software out there that exists and is very successful, purely because a big giant 800 pound gorilla had some key issues that they never wanted to resolve. So some other companies did it for them with a different solution, right? You could be that company. Or you could solve the problem with your own software. If you're the one that people are complaining about, and use it as a as a new marketing Avenue. What's something they're forced to interact with? That's difficult to understand or hard to get done? Well, something they are forced to interact with, that's difficult to understand or hard to get done. Even if your product or service does not resolve this problem yet itself. Right? Maybe it'll, you know, jog some ideas, or we can add that or maybe if we just did an article about that, you know, that would be something that could attract our audience and pull them in. So don't necessarily limit it to just the stuff that your product or service solves not yet. What something they're forced to interact with. That's hard to understand. And that lets you know, hard to get done. And then finally, what negative social consequences or changes in status do they fear the most. And conversely, what positive social changes or fear and status I know, for our people I know know, for our people, because we hear it, especially at the executive level, they are terrified of getting fired. Directors of marketing, marketing managers, VPs of marketing, they are terrified of getting fired, they're terrified that if they can't figure out this digital stuff, that they're gonna get found out, that the boss is going to kick them out, and that they're going to bring in some new young whippersnapper to replace them. That is their biggest fear that is a, you know, getting let go getting getting laid off, especially if you're getting replaced by a younger, better version of yourself supposedly, is a gigantic hit to status. All right. So what is it for you? What are the status issues that they might that they might be resolving? These are all external. Now let's have fun. Let's talk seasonal, let's talk holiday. So I've included a holiday planner, so you can get a sense of where things are going. Now, obviously, if, if you're down in southern hemisphere, if you're our friends in Australia, you're going to kind of need to flip this just a little bit with some things because when it's freezing here in the States, it's quite warm and nice where you are, but I'm guessing you can figure that out. But it gives you a sense of you know, what, what's going on, you know, what, what are some of the themes that persists? I want to really break this down and give you some other examples. Let's look at January, right? What are some common holidays in January, obviously, health fitness diet, but also organization resolution, January is a magical month, December similarly, that this is when people just are open to change. January it is a portal from one year to a new year. And anytime humans pass through a portal, they are very much open to change. So that's why I don't care if you have nothing to do with health fitness diet, right? Still, in the month of January, that is an opportunity for you to present a new offer because that is when humans are most open to change January resolution season. Lots of resolutions, make sure that you're active with your marketing here with a message that is about change. February, Valentine's Day, Presidents Day Black History Month heart health, okay, these are all themes around that particular month. Most of these are not holidays, per se, they may not be a holiday, you know where you are Presidents Day is obviously you know, specific to, you know, to the US, but a good theme. Love. You know, that's why heart health is was added. You know, in that particular month, March. Easter often falls in March, sometimes April, but you have Easter St Patrick's Day, March Madness, which is the college tournament here in the States, Women's History Month sleep awareness. I didn't know that National Nutrition Month. The funny thing about this and that's why you should google certain holidays. The Holidays don't have to be known by your audience to still be meaningful if you simply tell them if you're matched or you say hey, March is sleep Awareness Month. Oh, it is yeah, that's why it's a great time to buy a mattress. Okay. Right. I mean, one has nothing to do with another but it's it gives you an opportunity. It's something to highlight. Let's look at April. Passover, April Fool's Day, right. There's some fun things that you could do in terms of playing a joke but still having you know a sale or some stuff around that earth today, Arbor Day, Administrative Professionals day if you're a b2b type offering. May national teachers day Cinco Demayo Mother's Day Kentucky Derby Armed Forces it's a big one because it's we're getting into summer, spring, spring or summer cleaning. I guess it's you know, spring cleaning extended do this is another time when you'll have people just purge and do another spring clean in the summer vacation planning and swimsuit season. Alright, so this is when people are starting to think freedom vacation a great time to sell books and stuff like that. Right? That's that's when they want to do more passive consumption. And then June National Safety Month, Father's Day graduation. I thought that was funny. National Donut Day. Who knew that was a thing and national best friend's day again the holiday doesn't have to be known by your market to still be meaningful. Let's keep going July. Candidate A fourth of July. Parents the ice cream day Hot Dog Day tequila day. People are having a lot of fun in July. National Parks month national picnic month. Right clearly this is picnic season. This is family. Go with the theme right What is the theme of this? August back to school football. National Dog Day beard day. Yay. Sister day who knew right? September Labor Day Grandparents Day National cheeseburger day. You also get the beginning of fall. Right fall. Now people prior to that they're very open. They're out now they're beginning to close in they're beginning to turn in and get back to family. October Coffee Day Yom Kippur war. Well Food Day Hey, cats, no dogs, I guess got August cats get October. Halloween is one of the is the one of the largest, I think it is the largest celebrated holiday for adults. Crazy Halloween big, big big deal. November
Thanksgiving Black Friday. It Black Friday is now the entire month of November all over the world, it is crazy. You get small business Daylight Savings elections, if it's that time of year. And then December, holiday promotions, you know, you can do your last chance tax deductions into the Year special offer. And really, resolutions, begin in December, if you would do your January offer starting in December, can be very, very effective. So these are just kind of here to to jog your memory, get some ideas going. It's worth doing some searches, though, to see if there's more that are relevant to your market because these are very, very, very predictable. So again, now it's your turn, get your team together, get out all the post it notes and brainstorm as many ideas as you can and fill up that predictable sales canvas with all the ideas that you possibly can come up with. Hopefully, you run out of space long before you run out of ideas. And if that happens, that's okay because it just a little bit I'm going to show you how to actually filter them and create a hierarchy and which ones you should start with but for now, forget the filtering. There are no bad ideas just write down as many of them as you can involving as many people on your team as possible. Once you have all the ideas once this thing is so filled up that you can't even see the the paper anymore. Then you're done and you're ready to move on to the next video.

How to Rank Your Triggering Events
Alright, so now we are back. And it is time to actually rank your triggering events that you brainstormed in the previous video. So hopefully you took my advice and you just filled up this section of your predictable sales Canvas, we hopefully can't even see the freakin paper, hopefully using different colors. And so it's just a rainbow of excitement and enthusiasm and craziness so crazy and exciting. But we got to narrow it down, we got to filter down because heck, you can't target everything, you can't message anything we got to figure out, you know, what do we start with, right? And usually, what we're asking ourselves and recognizing is that some triggering events are obviously going to be more predictable than others in similarly, some triggering events are going to have more impact than others. So this idea of impact versus predictability, right? Clearly, if something is high, high impact, and highly predictable, right? That's the sweet spot, high impact, high predictability. That's a triggering event that we maybe want to begin to build some predictable selling systems around. If it's high impact, but not very predictable. You know, that could be great, but it might require a little more manual labor. So depending on the strategy, maybe that's, you know, maybe that's a good fit, maybe not. And if it's ultra predictable, but no real impact, then what's the point? You're kind of answering a question that nobody's asking. So how do we kind of balance this out, we're gonna use a predictability impact grid, we use something similar, if you recall, we were identifying, you know, ideal, ideal sales conversations, we're doing the same thing here. So we want to take the team and plot it on this spectrum, the higher the more predictable it is, the higher up it goes, the greater the impact the further over that it goes. So if we're thinking about something like a job promotion, for example, right, a job promotion, this is something that's massive impact. If somebody gets promoted to a chief marketing officer or a VP of marketing or director of marketing, there's a good chance that they're gonna want Digital Marketer HQ, right? They're right there in that sweet spot. They've got the team. They the timing is right, they've got the budget. This is high impact. But it's not very predictable. Because I'm not friends with every single CEO on planet Earth. They're not sent an email saying, Hey, Ryan, FYI, about to promote, you know, Fred, might want to send an email in a couple of days, right? I wish that were happening, but it just isn't. So job promotion, low high on the impact, low unpredictability. Starting an agency, funnily enough, this is actually relatively predictable. If somebody starts an agency, there's certain things that they tend to do, we're able to target and they start following different groups on Facebook, we can find them if they begin to join these things, it's easier than one might think. And it's actually pretty impactful, somebody starting an agency, they've got a team that they're gonna need to train it on board and all things digital marketing. So that's a decently you know, that's pretty good one into the year, into the year, highly predictable. We know exactly when every year is going to end, especially now that that whole Mayan Calendar thing is done. We're pretty much set on this one. And it's actually pretty high impact, right? It's pretty high when it comes to impact because that's when people are making changes. They're making decisions, that's when they have budget that they need to spend. Right So end of the year pretty good. Attending Traffic and Conversion Summit. That's really a sweet spot, right? We know exactly when it's gonna be. Heck, it's our event, we scheduled it. So predictability really high and insanely high. From an impact perspective, somebody attends Traffic and Conversion Summit, there's a really great chance that they should invest in Digital Marketer HQ, either for themselves or their company or their clients. What about inbound? Okay, inbound Summit, this is hub spots, big conference, again, very predictable, not quite as predictable as ours from year to year, like we know exactly when ours is going to be inbound, we know when it's going to be when they announce it. So very predictable and decent on the impact. Right? Not as impactful as attending our event, but still pretty solid. How about St. Patrick's Day, highly predictable, I know exactly what St. Patrick's Day is going to be. But you know what? Nobody frickin cares. Hey, it's St. Patrick's Day, you should change, you should train your digital marketing team using digital marketer HQ. I'm sure we'd have had we do this exercise in our office, we're gonna have some chucklehead in our office safely voted to predict. So that's why I put that up there. And also running the marathon. Now we're talking about something that is neither predictable nor impactful. Right? I don't know if we've ever had a marketing executive say, you know, because I just ran that marathon. Digital Marketer HQ, that's for me, never happened. So there's an example of something that is neither predictable nor impactful. Now we want to do is overlay the grid. Remember, the green area in the upper right hand corner, that's the sweet spot really anything even touching that area? We know we want to invest we know that we want to take a close look at it. Anything in the red you can pretty much immediately disqualified anything in the red area neither predictable nor impactful. And now we're looking at the yellow. So much of it depends on your strategy. Right so much depends on your strengths. So maybe Look at it, you go. St. Patrick's Day. Yeah, highly predictable, but not that stupid. What about everything else into the year, inbound? Yep, we can make this investment starting an agency, we can do that job promotion, really low on the predictable on the predictability scale. But it's so impactful that maybe it makes sense to bring in a sales development representative, that all they do is just creepily stalk people on on LinkedIn, and every single time they get a promotion, you know, we're looking at it, we're beginning to engage with them, right. So if it's predictable, if it's impactful enough, even if it's low on the predictability scale, not going to do it. Typically, if it's, you know, if it's kind of too far beyond this point, from an impact perspective, it may not be worth investing in like so, for example, sponsoring other events, kind of on the edge. In this case, though, that's something that we do, it's impactful enough, and it's predictable enough that we're gonna go ahead and make that investment. So we look at all these, what we're going to do next is plot them in order go back to this canvas, we don't have to throw away all the other ideas, they're fine, we may come back to them later. But get and plot in order. know we're going to focus on and know the, you know, two, three, maybe four at most triggering events that you are going to focus on in creating your predictable sales canvas and getting a whole lot more ideal sales conversations. Once you've done this, we can move on to the next video and get into your action items.

Action Items
Alright, so we are coming to the end of this particular module. And now it is time for your action items on identifying the triggering events really simple, you should already know what they are the first one, make a list of all the possible triggering events that could cause someone to start seeking the solution that you use. And I love using post it notes for this, I love gathering the whole team together, it can be really fun. By the way, when you see that some people keep saying the same thing, stack those post it notes on top of one another. Because if everybody's got the same ideas, and you got this nice, thick stack, just sticking it, you know, sitting in an area that tells you that clearly this is everybody's thinking this, it's obvious, it's predictable, it's something that you should consider going after. That's another way to sort of prioritize, but involve your team. All right, have fun with it, write them out, stick them to it, then rank them. Alright, get those triggering events ranked using the predictability impact chart, and then go back to your predictable sales canvas, write them down on that, get it codified. Get them going. And once you've done that, you will have identified your triggering events. More importantly, you will have identified the entry point into your predictable selling system. This is gonna help with the messaging that's going to help with targeting and it's going to help with coming up with entry point offer ideas, which is what we're going to cover in the next module. All right, so really big, really important step shouldn't take you that long. But it is a lot of fun. Okay, so get out those post it notes, start slapping those things on your particular sales canvas. And once you've done that, we can move on and start coming up with some of your entry point offer ideas. Thanks
